## Likelihood-Based Inference for Time Series Extremes

The **lite** package performs likelihood-based inference for stationary
time series extremes. The general approach follows [Fawcett and Walshaw
(2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/env.2133). There are 3 independent parts
to the inference, all performed using maximum likelihood estimation.

1.  A Bernoulli ($p_u$) model for whether a given observation exceeds
    the threshold $u$.
2.  A generalised Pareto, GP ($\sigma_u, \xi$), model for the marginal
    distribution of threshold excesses.
3.  The $K$-gaps model for the extremal index $\theta$, based on
    inter-exceedance times.

For parts 1 and 2 it is necessary to adjust the inferences because we
expect that the data will exhibit cluster dependence. This is achieved
using the methodology developed in [Chandler and Bate
(2007)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asm015) to produce a
log-likelihood that is adjusted for this dependence. This is achieved
using the [chandwich
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=chandwich). For part 3, the
methodology described in [SÃ¼veges and Davison
(2010)](https://doi.org/10.1214/09-AOAS292) is used, implemented by the
function `kgaps` in the [exdex
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exdex). The (adjusted)
log-likelihoods from parts 1, 2 and 3 are combined to make inferences
about return levels.

### An example: Cheeseboro wind gusts

The function `flite` makes inferences about
$(p_u, \sigma_u, \xi, \theta)$. We illustrate this using the
`cheeseboro` data from the [exdex
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exdex), which contains
hourly wind gust data from each January over the 10-year period
2000-2009.

First, we make inferences about the model parameters.

``` r
library(lite)
cdata <- exdex::cheeseboro
# Each column of the matrix cdata corresponds to data from a different year
# flite() sets cluster automatically to correspond to column (year)
cfit <- flite(cdata, u = 45, k = 3)
```

Then, we make inferences about the 100-year return level, including 95%
confidence intervals. The argument `ny` sets the number of observations
per year, which is $31 \times 24 = 744$ for these data.

``` r
rl <- returnLevel(cfit, m = 100, level = 0.95, ny = 31 * 24)
rl
#> 
#> Call:
#> returnLevel(x = cfit, m = 100, level = 0.95, ny = 31 * 24)
#> 
#> MLE and 95% confidence limits for the 100-year return level
#> 
#> Normal interval:
#>  lower     mle   upper  
#>  69.80   88.62  107.44  
#> Profile likelihood-based interval:
#>  lower     mle   upper  
#>  75.89   88.62  125.43
```
