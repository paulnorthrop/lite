Description: Performs likelihood-based inference for stationary time series 
    extremes.  The general approach follows Fawcett and Walshaw (2012)
    <doi:10.1002/env.2133>.  Marginal extreme value inferences are adjusted for 
    cluster dependence in the data using the methodology in Chandler and Bate 
    (2007) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>, producing an adjusted log-likelihood 
    for the model parameters.  A log-likelihood for the extremal index is 
    produced using the K-gaps model of Suveges and Davison (2010) 
    <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292>. These log-likelihoods are combined to make 
    inferences about extreme values. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian 
    approaches are available.
