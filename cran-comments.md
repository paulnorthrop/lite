## Resubmission

In this version I have

* Provided the \value tags in estfun.Rd and logLikVector.Rd that were missing in the original submission.
* Improved the explanations in the \value tags elsewhere, particularly those that were flagged.
* Reset the par() settings after they were changed in the package vignette.
